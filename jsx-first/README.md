This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps I used to create this Simple App

In the project directory, you can run:

#### 1. Install Node.js in your Local Machine.

#### 2. Bring the create-react-app package using npm
### `npm create-react-app`

#### 3. Now Create a new React App using the create-react-App
### `create-react-app jsx-first`

#### 4. Now I crated the index.js under /src with the react and ReactDOM and then Do the npm command to start the Server.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Final Result on WebPage : Hello World
